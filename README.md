# Advanced formula environment, a Microsoft Garage project

Create and edit named formulas using a powerful formula editor. With the advanced formula environment you can:
- Write named formulas using an editor that supports inline errors, intellisense, comments, and more.
- Indent formulas, making them easier to read.
- Edit all named formulas using a single code editor.
- Quickly reuse LAMBDA formulas by importing them from GitHub gists, or by copying them for other workbooks.

The advanced formula environment (AFE) works in Excel for Desktop, Web, and Mac, without installing any additional software. All you need to do to get started is get the add-in from the Office store: https://aka.ms/get-afe.

The Microsoft Garage is an outlet for experimental projects for you to try. Learn more at https://garage.microsoft.com.

We currently only support one locale where `,` is the argument separator and `;` is the name assignment separator. Localization feature requests can be tracked under Issues.

This repository contains documentation and examples only.

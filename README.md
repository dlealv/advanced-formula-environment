# Advanced formula environment, a Microsoft Garage project

Create and edit formulas using a powerful formula editor. With the advanced formula environment you can:
- View, format, and edit formulas defined in the grid with an advanced formula bar.
- Define and edit named functions, ranges, and formulas that can be synchronised with the Name Manager.
- Create collections of named functions called modules that are defined as code and stored as part of the Workbook.
- Quickly import LAMBDA modules directly from GitHub gists.

The advanced formula environment (AFE) works in Excel for Desktop, Web, and Mac, without installing any additional software. All you need to do to get started is get the add-in from the Office store: https://aka.ms/get-afe.

The Microsoft Garage is an outlet for experimental projects for you to try. Learn more at https://garage.microsoft.com.

#### Localisation

AFE has some support for localisation of formulas and no support for localisation of app text. Formulas in AFE must be edited using a comma argument separator, such as `=SUM(1,2,3)`, however AFE will interact with workbooks using other separators such as semi-colon (`;`). When reading or saving a formula, AFE will automatically translate between formats. Function names can be written using the workbookâ€™s locale, but AFE provides a setting to force English function names.
AFE will eventually support full formula localisation, rather than requiring comma argument separators.
